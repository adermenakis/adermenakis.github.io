ABOUT MYSELF
======

Over the years I have acquired experience working in both technical and managerial positions. I have been guiding technically and architecturally teams of 4 to 16 developers in both new and existing projects. Some of my most notable projects were the technical planning and guidance to bring large in-house databases to the Azure Cloud (General Mills) and being the architect on the DAM upgrade of Hilton on Azure. Furthermore, I have been providing technical support for integrations to big customers such as General Motors and guiding on Cloud Development.
Apart from the private sector, I have also worked on government projects. My experience is with the Belgian government where I was responsible for undertaking the implementation of a traffic control system, consisting of a web and a mobile application.
