[**Color Profile support on Embedded Systems**](/iccColorProfiles/) |
![](/assets/data/projects/icc.jpg) | This section provides information an how to perform color profile conversion on Embedded devices. My approach uses Qt since I conducted this research while doing my thesis work at the Qt office in Oslo, Norway. Picture on the left downloaded from [here](http://www.largeformatreview.com/images/stories/software/colour/icc.jpg){:target="_blank"}

[**Cloth Simulation**](/ClothSimulation/)  |
![](/assets/data/projects/large_ClothSimScreen1.jpg) | Cloth Simulation project based on [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/){:target="_blank"}, [GLOW](http://glow.sourceforge.net/){:target="_blank"}, [GLUT](http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/){:target="_blank"}, [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/){:target="_blank"}, [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page){:target="_blank"}. The project uses the cloth simulation technique described in the ["Game Developer Magazine"](http://www.darwin3d.com/gamedev/articles/col0599.pdf){:target="_blank"}, May 1999 and is based on [Dr. J. Mosegaard's Implementation](http://www.jespermosegaard.dk/){:target="_blank"}.

[**Ulallama: Project Zombie**](/ulallamaprojectzombie/) | |
![](/assets/data/projects/large_ulallama_track1_screen1.jpg) | "Ulallama: Project Zombie" is a 3D game that was designed and developed within a timeframe of two weeks. It is based on [XNA 3.1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=80782277-d584-42d2-8024-893fcd9d3e82){:target="_blank"} and [JigLibX](http://jiglibx.codeplex.com/){:target="_blank"}, and is a Racing/task based game. The cars,scenery objects and zombies were downloaded from [Turbosquid](http://www.turbosquid.com/){:target="_blank"} and the game tracks were constructed with [3ds Max 2011](http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/){:target="_blank"} (Student Edition).

[**WifiHotSpot**](/node/10/)	 | |
![](/assets/data/projects/thumb_Wifi_Hot_spot_Linux_open_suse.png) | This tool is just a GUI frontend that executes several system commands and uses hostAP daemon tool for creating an Infrastructure netowork on Linux.

[**AVR MP3 Player**](/node/11/)	| |
![](/assets/data/projects/large_mp3_1.jpg) | This is an Mp3 player based on an ATMega32 that uses the Nokia 5510 screen and the VS1003 audio decoder chip.

[**libFINS**](/libFINS/) | |
![]() | This library allows communicating with Omron PLCs with the Omron FINS protocol. The implementation has functions for reading/writing data to the PLC's memory pool. It is limited to ethernet communication but RS-232 can be added easily.

[**Implementing IK (Inverse Kinematics)**](/InverseKinematicsTutorial/) | |
![](/assets/data/projects/large_IKScreenshot.jpg) | This tutorial provides the mathematical background for understanding Inverse Kinematics (IK). The sample code of this tutorial is in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering. The movement of the arm is computed through the inverse Jacobian.
