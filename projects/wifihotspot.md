# Wifi Hot-Spot Linux

This is a wifi hot-stop for linux that I developed. It uses iptables, hostapd, ifconfig and dhcpd for setting up a wireless router on your laptop/desktop. It allows bridging network interfaces and setting up a dhcp server connected to the wireless interface.

The full source code is provided that puts all the aforementioned together. You can also use the source code to get the configuration required for hostapd, iptables and dhcpd. I have tested it only on OpenSuse 11.4 and 12.1, theoretically it should work everywhere where iptables, hostapd and dhcpd are installed under /usr/bin/.
