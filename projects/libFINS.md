# libFINS Omron PLC Communication library

This libFINS library allows communicating with Omron PLCs with the Omron FINS protocol. The implementation has functions for reading/writing data to the PLC's memory pool. It is limited to ethernet communication but RS-232 can be added easily.

The compressed library contains some sample code on how to use the library written in C++. The license of the library is LGPL hence if you would like to add anything feel free to do so you but remember you have to publish the code wink(but it would be nice to send me the code as well).

The source code has been moved to github. Link : [https://github.com/adermenakis/libFINS](https://github.com/adermenakis/libFINS){:target="_blank"}
